# CSE-5544-Assignment1



---I have included a file with links to two Tableau Public visualizations.

---I have also included two MATLAB files that contain my other two visualizations. They are labeled "ASSIGNMENT1.M" and "Assignment1_Matlab2.M"
---Additionally, I have posted files containing my MATLAB source code for each of my visualizations. 


My favorite visualization I created is the plot using circles I created in Tableau. I think it most effectively showed changes in medical encounters over time based on gender. The colors are visually appealing and you can easily extract a lot of information from it. 


MATLAB - This was a good tool because of the customization that was possible. Because I was able to code and manipulate the csv files however I wished, I was able to do a lot of different things with the data. MATLAB also has many built in functions that allowed for much easier manipulation of the data. For example, I used a funciton called datevec to help convert the serial date number into an array of month, day, and year. These functions helped me take analyze the data by year. Also, everything ran extremely fast on MATLAB. Since there is no uploading and nothing online, MATLAB ran quite efficiently and let me analyze a great amount of data quickly. Now, to the bad. In comparison to Tableau, MATLAB is much much more difficult to customize graphics. There is no GUI that the user can look at to easily change the visualizations like there is in Tableau.


Tableau - Tableau made it very easy to visualize the data given. The user interface was great for choosing which data I want to show and manipulating the data in ways I wanted. It was extremely easy to choose which data I wanted in rows and columns in each of my visualizations. Also, it was easy to quickly test out different types of visualizations. After getting the data I wanted into Tableau, it was easy to very quickly see which type of chart would best fit the data. Also, Tableau Public allows you to create visualizations that can easily be put online to share with others. Once it is online, Tableau makes it very easy to hilight certain points to look even closer at the visualization. Now, the bad with tableau. Unfortunately, Tableau is not fully customizable. With the great user interface, I think you sacrice some ability to fully customize your visualization to how you want it. In MATLAB it is not too difficult to simply add an extra line somewhere on the graph, but it is much more difficult with Tableau. While tableau gives you a ton of options, there might be a few small things that are very hard to do- like moving a part of the chart slightly for example.
